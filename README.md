# pkmnmap4
A rip of <https://pkmnmap.com> updated to Generation 4 of the Pok√©mon series. Uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to generate an interactive map. Map assembled from resources from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Platinum_locations). Item locations sourced from [Techno Trainer's video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDHidtsnukfIVS-VhbJRuxHVfKgmPduIE&si=agUfWjlSWxbYmLkX). Without these resources and the original code from [Jaxson Keenes](https://www.jaxsonkeenes.com/) this project would not exist.

The site is available at <https://pkmnmap4.web.app/>.

## how to generate a new tileset
1. Procure a high-resolution map of whatever you want to make a tileset out of. make sure the dimensions of the map image are easily halved, don't worry if you have to add a lot of whitespace
1. I've included my personal script for converting a large png into a tileset with multiple zoom levels in this respository as `ImageToTileset` in `HelperTools.py`. It will resize your map to the various zoom levels, and for each resize it will split the image into 256x256 pixel tiles which then get arranged into the proper directory structure for Leaflet to be able to render your map.
1. install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
1. install wand as a prerequisite for HelperTools.py
1. Run the following in your favorite Python interpreter:
```
from HelperTools import ImageToTileset
ImageToTileset(r"[path to your png map]", r"[directory you want the tileset to be placed]")
```
6. To see your new map, you can update Overworld.js to point to the tileset directory, just make sure to change `tileX` and `tileY` in main.js to be representative of your map's aspect ratio.

## how to create new regions
1. Open your final map png in an image editor like Paint.NET
1. Select the area you wish to turn into a clickable region
1. Make note of the following values: Selection top left coordinate, selection width and height.
1. Insert those values into my helper function:
```
from HelperTools import Translate
Translate(x, y, w, h)
```
5. Copy and paste the output into the "coordinates" property of a feature in one of the vector js files.
    Note: `Translate()` may not work depending on the bounds set for your map.

## how to create new interiors
1. Create a new tileset for your map
1. Add your map's information to `maps.js`
1. Add vector data to the variable you defined in the map's information
1. Add marker data for your interior using `markerSet()`
1. Finally, add an entrance marker to the overworld with the description matching the new map's name.
